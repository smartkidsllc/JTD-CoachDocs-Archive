# Using a 3D Printer

Inorder to run a successful 3D printing camp knowing how to operate a printer is utmost important. Knowing all the components of a 3D, both hardware and software, printer is also important and will be mentioned throughout the documentation.

## Hardware

Inorder to run a successful 3D printing camp knowing how to operate a printer is utmost important. Knowing all the components of a 3D, both hardware and software, printer is also important and will be mentioned throughout the documentation.

Every 3D printer is going to vary but the same concepts apply. The current 3D printer located at the center is the [Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer/) (This may change in the future) and its [operating manual can be downloaded](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads/mk3s-2/handbook) if needed.

Some of our vendors may have 3D printers on site that will be different from our 3D printer.

### Loading Filament

Inorder to load the filament you first need to Locate the print head on the 3D printer. Some 3D printers have the Filament loaded into a special loading area so you would need to refer to that 3D printers manual.
