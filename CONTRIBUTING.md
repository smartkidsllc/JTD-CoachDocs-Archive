# Contributing to the SmartKids Docs

If you want to contribute to the SmartKids Docs, then you’ll need to have a GitHub account. You can learn more about registering a GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

Once you have a GitHub account, there’s two main things that you can do in order to help improve the SmartKids Docs:

1. Filing issues
2. Submitting pull requests

## Filing issues

An issue is like an item on a to-do list. Issues say “we should do X”, but they usually don’t contain the code that we need in order to do X. Filing issues is easy. Anyone can file issues, even if they aren’t very technically savy.

To get started, you’ll need to identify a way that the SmartKids Docs site could be improved. Here are some examples:

-   “I noticed that there were spelling or grammatical errors.”
-   “I read this part of the site, but it was confusing to me.”
-   “It would be nice if this part of the site had more details.”
-   “I want to learn more about teaching X, but the site doesn’t have any information about X.”

Once you’ve identified a way that the site could be improved, then you can file an issue by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

## Submitting pull requests

A pull request is a proposed change. Pull requests allow you to formally propose that specific lines of text are added or removed from the site. Submitting pull requests is more difficult than filing issues, but they aren’t too bad once you get the hang of it.

To get started, you’ll need to identify a way that the SmartKids Docs site could be improved (see [the previous section](#filing-issues) for more details). Once you have an idea, you can create a pull request just like you would for any other GitHub repository. If you don’t already know how to create a GitHub pull request, then please follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). If you get stuck while following that tutorial, then don’t hesitate to ask a fellow employee for help.

Once you start working on your pull request, here are a few tips that you may find useful:

-   [The README has instructions for how to build and run the site locally.](./README.md#building-and-previewing-the-site-locally)
-   The SmartKids Docs site is built using Docusaurus. You may want to take a look at [the documentation for Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) in order to learn more about what you can do with Docusaurus.
